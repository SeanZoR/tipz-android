Tipz.io - Learn Android Best Practices By Example
======================================

This project is a sample project that demonstrates how to build an Android app.

## Covered subjects ##
Covering a bunch of development process steps and best practices. Providing a "cook book" for successful, agile, clean process. Area we'll talk about: `REST`, `Android studio`, `Gradle`, `Maven`, `ProGuard`, `Intellij Inspections`, `Lint`, `Build variants`, `Flavours`, `Strict mode`, `MAT`, `Google play beta and rollouts`, `Graphical design`, `Performance`, `Automation`, `Unit testing`, `Git workflow`, `Jenkins`... And much more!

## How to learn ##
Learning is best done through actual examples. So, This project leverages Github tools and showcase the needed info on the project "as we go":
  - `commit` - the basic comment will describe the general step, while further info will be commented in the Github as markdown comments
  - `pull request` - will capsulate multiple commits that describe a full feature in cases we will want to demonstrate "the big picture"

##What is 'Tipz'?##
For the learning purposes, we will be using **Tipz.io** API in order to create a real RESTfull application.
